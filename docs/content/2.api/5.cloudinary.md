# Cloudinary Service

Here you can find all the information to interact with the Cloudinary Service. In this Service we use GraphQL to interact with the database Cloudinary, you can interact with the database using Insomnia, Postman, Thunder CLient, etc, in the following url: [http://localhost:3001/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql)

## `Upload Test Image`

If you want to upload a test image, follow the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation ($image: Upload!) {
  uploadTestImage(image: $image)
}
```

You will get a response like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "uploadTestImage": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dwobggrrq/image/upload/v1696900000/image.webp"
  }
}
```

### `Request for clients like Insomia, Postman, Thunder Client, etc`

Operations with files from a client external to the playground must be done in multipart/form-data format, so the following steps will be followed to make a request with the example of the previous mutation (Upload Test Image)

- Operations JSON:

```json
{
  "query": "mutation ($image: Upload!) { uploadTestImage(image: $image) }",
  "variables": { "file": null }
}
```

- Map JSON:

```json
{ "0": ["variables.image"] }
```

# Auth

Here you can find all the information to interact with the authentication. In this CRUD we use GraphQL to interact with the database, you can interact with the database using the GraphQL playground in the following url: [http://localhost:3001/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql)

## Local login

To log in and obtain an authentication token, you can use the following GraphQL mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  login(email: "user@example.com", password: "yourpassword")
   {
    token
    userId
  }
}
```

### Token Verification

After obtaining an authentication token, you can use it to access protected resources. To verify a token and retrieve user information, you can use the following GraphQL query:

```graphql
query {
  verifyToken(token: "your-authentication-token")
  {
      sub
      username
  }
}
```

You will get a response like this:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "verifyToken": {
      "sub": "user-id",
      "username": "username"
    }
  }
}
```
